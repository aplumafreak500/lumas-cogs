# Luma's Redbot v3 Cog Repository
This is a repository of cogs for [Redbot v3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). Notable commands are complete reimplementations of commands from the Star Vs. The Forces of Discord bot, Cobalt, although some other commands will be offered.

**This is a work in progress. Some functionality may not work as intended.**

**Pull requests are welcome!**
